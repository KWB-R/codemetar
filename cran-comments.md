Dear CRAN Maintainers,

I am pleased to submit the codemetar package for generating codemeta.json files for R packages. Note that
this package uses the X-schema.org-* pattern as previously discussed and recommended by CRAN maintainers (Kurt Hornik, Aug 27),
please let me know if this needs to be revised in any way. Thanks!

The title now uses single quotes around 'CodeMeta' as requested.  (Package description also uses these quotes.) 

Thanks!

Carl
